# Introduction

👋 Welcome to the official documentation for Creao AI!

CREAO is a platform that simplifies the creation, configuration, testing, and deployment of AI agents. By offering an integrated environment to register external tools, manage knowledge assets, and configure agents for various use cases, CREAO helps users quickly build and iterate on agentic workflows. Through an interactive chat-like “playground” experience, you can test each agent’s behavior, making it easy to refine executions and outputs. 🎉

## 🚀 Why You'll Love CREAO

- Seamless Agent Creation: Configure agents with minimal effort through an intuitive Agent Studio interface and create agent using natural language.
- Mock & Real Tools: Rapidly prototype agents with generated “mock” tools, then switch to real, registered tools once ready.
- Knowledge Integration: Provide documents, URLs, or text that CREAO can chunk and store in a vector database for use in planning and execution.
- Configurable Environments: Use multiple environment settings in a single project to test or compare different tool or knowledge configurations.
- Interactive Playground: Experiment with your agents’ execution logic and refine them on the fly.

## 📚 Here's What You're Going to Master
