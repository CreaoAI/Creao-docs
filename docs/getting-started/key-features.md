# Key Features

Creao AI helps you create, optimize, and deploy agentic workflows autonomously. Below, we highlight the key features that enable you to do just that.

## Workflow Creation

- **Effortless Workflow Setup**: Upload a dataset, provide a prompt, and let the Meta Agent handle the complexities of generating and executing agents.
- **Responsive to Changes**: Update your workflow any time to integrate new data, accommodate shifting tasks, and meet fresh requirements, from creation to deployment.

## Agent Observability

Understanding and refining workflows is key to unlocking their full potential. Creao AI equips you with the tools for visibility into every facet of the process.

- **Agent Details**: Take a deeper look into the agent's attributes, structure, and code.

  - Access essential metrics such as scores, modifications, and evaluation type.
  - Inspect the agentâ€™s code and visualize its structure.
  - Explore the operators driving your agentâ€™s capabilities.
