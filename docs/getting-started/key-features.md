# Key Features

Creao AI helps you create, optimize, and deploy agentic workflows autonomously. Below, we highlight the key features that enable you to do just that.

## Tools & Resources 🛠️

Creao AI provides a robust tools and resources registration system that defines the execution environment for the Meta Agent:

- **Tools Registration**: Register custom tools and APIs that agents can utilize
- **Resources Registration**: Configure resources like databases and external services
- **Mock API Support**: This feature will allow you to simulate API interactions, enabling you to test and develop your workflows without needing live endpoints if you dont have any tools and resources available. It is currently under development and will be available soon. Stay tuned for updates! 🔄

Together, these components create a flexible environment where agents can effectively execute their workflows. The mock API capability ensures you can start building immediately, even before integrating your production tools.

## Workflow Creation 🧩

- **Effortless Workflow Setup**: Upload a dataset, provide a prompt, and let the Meta Agent handle the complexities of generating and executing agents.
- **Responsive to Changes**: Update your workflow any time to integrate new data, accommodate shifting tasks, and meet fresh requirements, from creation to deployment.

## Agent Observability 👀

Understanding and refining workflows is key to unlocking their full potential. Creao AI equips you with the tools for visibility into every facet of the process.

### Agent Generation Process

When agents are generating, our users will be able to see a modal pop up showing the generation process and detailed plan. This modal provides real-time insights into the steps being taken by the Meta Agent to create the workflow.

### Evaluation Score

Additionally, there's an evaluation score to benchmark the Meta Agent's performance on executing the task. This score helps you understand the effectiveness and efficiency of the generated agents, allowing for continuous improvement and optimization.

## Instant Deployment 🚀

Once the agent has a "ready for deployment" status, users will be able to click **Deploy** in the modal. This action will deploy the agent, making it ready for use. After deployment, users can click **Invoke** to utilize the agent as an API. This feature allows seamless integration of the agent into your existing systems, enabling automated task execution through API calls.

## Self-Improvement 🤖

The Meta Agent is designed to continuously improve itself. It learns from previous generations and adjusts its approach to achieve better results. This self-improvement process allows the Meta Agent to adapt to new situations and improve over time, ensuring it always performs at its best.
