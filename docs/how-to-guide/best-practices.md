# ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

1. **Plan Your Environments**

- Keep a development environment using mock tools to test new ideas. Then iteratively replace with real tools to ensure a cascading development process.

2. **Manage Knowledge Properly**

- Break large documents or references into meaningful chunks so the agent can retrieve them accurately.

3. **Use Predefined Steps Wisely**

- Provide enough context or instructions for more complex tasks. The agentâ€™s execution will be more accurate.

4. **Iterate Often**
   After each test run in the Playground Chat, refine your environment, knowledge, or agent configuration to get the better results.
