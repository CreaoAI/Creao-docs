### Upload Your Dataset

To create a custom project with your own data, follow these steps:

1. **Name Your Project**  
   Give your project a meaningful name that reflects the content or goal of your project.

2. **Enter Project Description**  
   Add a brief description of your project to provide context for the dataset you are uploading.

3. **Upload Your Dataset**  
   To upload your dataset, make sure it meets the following format requirements:

   - **File Format:** JSONL (.jsonl extension)
   - **Content:** Each line of the file must be a valid JSON object.
   - **Structure:** Each JSON object should contain business-related input and output data. For example:

     ```json
     {"question": "What is ML?", "answer": "Machine Learning..."}
     {"prompt": "Explain AI", "completion": "AI is..."}
     ```

4. **Create Project**  
   After uploading your dataset, click the **Create Project** button to proceed.

### Start with Templates

If you prefer to start with a predefined workflow:

1. **Choose a Template**  
   Pick a workflow that best aligns with your desired goal from the available options.

2. **Create Project**  
   Once youâ€™ve selected a template, click **Create** to start the project with the chosen template.

After creating your project, you'll be directed to the **Data Page** where you can further configure and analyze your project. For more details on the Data Page, see the next section.
