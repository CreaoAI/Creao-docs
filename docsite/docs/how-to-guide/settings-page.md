## üåü Introduction - Understanding and Using Input & Judge Prompts in Creao AI

Input and Judge prompts are the foundation of Creao AI's intelligent workflow system. They work together to create a powerful feedback loop that enables continuous improvement of your AI agents.

## Core Concepts

### What are Input & Judge Promts?

- **Input Prompt**: A template that instructs the AI how to generate outputs from your data
- **Judge Prompt**: A template that defines how to evaluate the quality of generated outputs

Think of them as:

- Input Prompt = "Here's how to do the task"
- Judge Prompt = "Here's how to evaluate if it was done well"
