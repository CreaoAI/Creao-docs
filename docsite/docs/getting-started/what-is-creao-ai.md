# What is Creao AI?

Creao AI is designed to automate and optimize workflow creation using
intelligent, adaptive agents. It eliminates the need for extensive
manual setup and enables scalable, efficient automation of complex
tasks. Through its **Meta Agent**, Creao AI leverages advanced
techniques like **auto-planning** and **iterative optimization** to
autonomously generate, refine, and deploy workflows, reducing human
intervention and increasing adaptability.

## What is Auto-Planning? 🧭

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in handling
complex tasks through structured workflows. However, creating these
workflows requires significant manual effort, and often times, the
workflows created are not optimal. This is where auto-planning comes in.

### How It Works

Auto-planning lets LLMs generate, fine-tune, and implement workflows on their own by tapping into their ability to understand and reason about tasks. With auto-planning, the Meta Agent continuously enhances workflows by:

- 📝 Modifying code
- 🧠 Building on past experiences
- 📊 Using execution feedback

This process helps workflows grow and get better over time, ensuring they are efficient and scalable for today's automation needs.

## Observability: Clear Insights into the Process 🔍

> We don't believe in the black box approach.

A major challenge in agent-based automation is making sure the development process is transparent. That's why Creao AI is designed to give you clear insights every step of the way. You'll always be aware of what's happening, ensuring complete visibility throughout the process.
